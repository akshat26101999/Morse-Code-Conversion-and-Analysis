    "\n",
    "### Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The project consists of three questions, each containing several sub-questions. You are expected (and warmly encouraged) to attempt every question and sub-question of this assignment. Fractional marks might be awarded for meaningful partial solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to provide working Python code that answers each question, and to accompany your code with appropriate explanations and comments. In particular, you should provide at least a brief text paragraph that explains what you did, and you should include meaningful comments inside your code, to explain what the code does. Failing to provide comments and/or explanations will most probably result in a partial loss of marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please read each question carefully before attempting an answer. In particular, please read each question and all its sub-questions **before attempting any part of it**, as this could help to avoid misinterpreting the question and to clarify some doubts that a partial read might leave.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is due by **Friday 13th January 2023, at 17:00 UTC**. Submissions received after that deadline will be treated in accordance with the College Regulations concerning late submissions. This means that late submissions will incur a penalty of 5% of the total marks for every day of delay (or fraction thereof), up to seven days after the submission deadline. For instance, a submission received with 25 hours of delay will incur a penalty of 10 marks of the 100 available. Any submission received more than 168 hours after the deadline stated above will score a zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lecturer will be available to answer reasonable questions about this assignment up until **Friday 6th January 2023**. You can contact the lecturer via email at [v.nicosia@qmul.ac.uk](mailto:v.nicosia@qmul.ac.uk)\n",

    "You must work independently on your project, and your submission should include only original material, code and comments, that you have produced by yourself. You are allowed to use any sources (books, internet, Google, etc.) to help you in completing this project, but you must cite them appropriately. The same applies to published code: if you use any publicly available code from a third party, you must cite the source appropriately, and specify what is your original contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to discuss the general approach to a question with your colleagues, but you cannot share your own code with colleagues or reuse code produced by your colleagues for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queen Mary University of London has in place a very efficient system for automatic plagiarism detection, which draws on a database of several million books, webpages, research articles, dissertations, and submissions to university-level modules from all over the world. All the material submitted for assessment is automatically processed by this system, which produces a detailed plagiarism report. If I suspect that any of the submitted material is plagiarised, the marks of the corresponding piece of assessment will be withheld until you can demonstrate that the code or material is genuinely your own. Any suspect case of copying or plagiarism will be referred to the School and the College for investigation. The typical outcome of a plagiarism investigation might be the failure of the corresponding piece of assessment, the failure of the module, or even the withdrawal of an awarded title and the expulsion from the College in more serious cases. Please refer to the QMUL Academic Regulations for more information about the definition of plagiarism and the relative penalties: \n",

    "## Introduction: The Morse Code\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is a method of encoding text messages, invented by [Samuel Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse) and perfected by his assistant [Alfred Vail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Vail), that represents letters, digits, and punctuation symbols as sequences of short and long pulses, also called \"dits\" and \"dahs\". The system was initially integral to the invention of the [Electrical Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph), which allowed for the first time to pass information across very large distances (from a few to several thousands kilometers) using electric wires. The original telegraph was very simple: you have an electric wire strung between points A and B, as in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"telegraph.png\" width=\"600px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the operator at location A wants to send a message to the operator at location B, they just have to \"tap\" the message on the wire, using an appropriate \"telegraphic key\". Obviously, the message must be in a form amenable to be \"tapped\" on the wire, and here is where the Morse/Vail Code comes into play. The operator at A needs to translate her message in a sequence of pulses, according to the Morse Code, and then they will \"tap\" the resulting sequence of short and long pulses on the wire, using a [telegraphic key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_key). You see below a picture of one of the earliest models of telegraphic key:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Vail_key.jpg\" width=\"600px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator at B will \"receive\" the sequence of short and long pulses through an appropriate machinery connected to the telegraphic wire, and will translate them back to characters and puctuation symbols, to recover the original message. The table below shows the International Morse Code for each letter, digit, and for some commonly-used punctuation symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Char| Code  |Char|Code   | Char| Code    |\n",
    "|--- |-------|----|-------|-----|---------|\n",
    "| A  | .-    | T  | -     | . (period) | .-.-.- |\n",
    "| B  | -...  | U  | ..-   | , (comma)  | --..-- |\n",

    "| Q  | --.-  | 9  | ----. |\n",
    "| R  | .-.   |    |    |\n",
    "| S  | ...   |    |    |\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the table above we realise that the word \"PYTHON\" would correspond to the sequence of symbols: \n",
    "\n",
    "        .--.  -.--  -  ....  ---  -.\n",
    "         P     Y    T    H    O   N\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have used a \".\" to represent a short pulse (dit) and a \"-\" to represent a long pulse (dah). Dits and dahs are called *elements*, so the code associated to each character can be composed by one or more *elements*, being dits or dahs. Notice that the Morse code makes no distinction between lowercase and uppercase letters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alfred Vail had the brilliant idea to assign letters to their code according to the corresponding frequency of that letter in English texts, so that the most common letters (i.e., those sent most frequently) would be associated to shorter codes. For instance, the five most common letters in English are \"E\", \"T\", \"A\", \"O\", \"I\", \"N\", and they are all associated to codes consisting of one or two elements (with the notable exception of \"O\", which has three elements!). Numbers are all associated to 5 elements, while all the codes for puntuation symbols consist of 5 or 6 elements. By doing so, the total time needed to transmit a message can be reduced substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the invention of the [Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_radio) at the beginning of the 20th century, by the Italian inventor and enginner [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi), the Morse Code became (and remained, for almost a century) the most widely-used mean of communication for long-range transmission, which soon enough included transoceanic transmissions on Low-, Medium- and High-Frequency radio waves. As such, the Morse Code was used for decades to exchange messages of commercial, military, and personal nature, as well as an efficient communication channel for boats and ships in distress. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get an idea of of how Morse Code \"sounds\" by listening to the recording below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<audio width=\" \" height=\" \"\n",
    "       src=\"prinsendam_sos.mp3\"  \n",
    "       controls>\n",
    "</audio>\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio track above reproduces the beginning of the distress message (SOS) sent by the ship Prinsendam on October 4th 1980. You will hear two long tones and then the Morse Code for \"SOS SOS SOS DE PJTA PJTA PJTA = PASSENGI I I PASSENGER SHIP PRINSENDAM/PJTA POSI\". Here \"SOS\" is the international distress signal, indicating a major incident, while \"PJTA\" is the unique identifier assigned to the ship for radio communications. The operator actually made a mistake while sending the \"R\" in \"PASSENGER\", so he sent two \"I\" to signal an error, and then repeated the word \"PASSENGER\". The whole message lasted for a few minutes, and the operator sent the position and the reason of the distress call, but we stopped the recording at the point when the operator was sending the word \"POSITION\". Luckily, the full message was heard by several other ships and coastal radio stations, rescue ships and boats were sent promptly, and all the passengers and crew of the Prinsendam were eventually saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although naval communications eventually ceased to use Morse Code and switched to a digital satellite system in the late 1990s, the Morse Code is still in wide use among Amateur Radio operators, as well as by military forces around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Independent Project you will implement Python code to encode and decode text messages in/from Morse Code, and to derive some interesting statistics about the efficiency of Morse Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "No worries: you do not need to know or learn the Morse Code, or to be able to decode it, as you will just deal with text messages and the textual representations of \"dits\" and \"dahs\"! The skills you have acquired in this module will be more than enough to successfully answer each of the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B.: the main aim of this assessment is for you to show that you can produce original Python programs to solve a given task. You are expected to produce original Python code, on your own. Whenever you have the choice between writing your own code or using some fancy function in a fancy module, prefer the former to the latter. In general, you can use any of the Python modules we have seen in the module, including but not limited to all the standard library modules (math, string, os, sys, re, etc...), numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, but you really need just a few of them to finish this assignment.**"

    "\n",
    "In this question you will produce Python code to encode plain text in Morse Code and vice-versa, i.e., decoding a representation of Morse Code characters back into plain text. Morse Code was actually meant to be an \"aural\" language, i.e., a language whose words are made of sounds, and in particular, of combinations of just two distinct sounds, namely a short pulse (dit) and a long pulse (dah). However, since producing sounds in Python in a portable way is not immediate, here we will use text to represent the Morse Code of characters. In particular, each \"dit\" element will be represented by a \".\" (period), and each \"dah\" element will be represented by a \"-\" (hyphen). The elements constituting a single character will be written without any space between them, so that the Morse Code representation of the letter `A` is `.-` (without any space between `.` and `-`).\n"

These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost. Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.

But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.

For instance, if the file `fname` consists of the 26 letters od of the English alphabet and no digit or punctuation symbol, the dictionary returned by `charStats()` will contain one key for each of the 26 letters, and the value associated to each letter will be equal to the number of times that letter appears in the file, divided by the total number of letters present in the file. The function `charStats()` will not distinguish uppercase and lowercase letters, to that all the occurrences of `A` and `a` will be counted under the same dictionary key `\"a\"` (lowercase). Moreover, the function should ignore any character that is not a key of the `Morse` dictionary you obtained in point 1(a) above."

For instance, in the list $L=\\{10, 27, 4.5, 31, 1, 10\\}$ the rank of the value $27$ is written $r(27)$ and is equal to $5$.

If the list $L$ contains two or more identical values, the rank of that value is the average of the ranks of its occurrences. For instance, the value $10$ in the list $L$ has rank $r(10)=(3+4)/2 = 3.5$, as its occurrences appear in 3rd and 4th position when the list $L$ is sorted in increasing order.\n",

    "The amount of time needed to transmit a message in Morse Code depends on the actual speed at which the message is being sent. As a matter of fact, the total duration of a Morse Code message is determined by the length of a single \"dit\", as the lengths of all the other elements, including \"dahs\" and spaces between elements, characters, and words, are defined as multiples of a single \"dit\". A commonly-used standard to define the speed of a Morse Code transmission uses the word \"PARIS\" as a reference. If we take into account also the trailing space at the end, the length of the word \"PARIS\" in Morse Code is equal of 50 dits. In this system, the speed of a Morse Code transmission is expressed in \"Words Per Minute\" (abbreviated \"wpm\" or \"WPM\") and is equal to the number of times the word \"PARIS\" can be transmitted in a minute, at that speed. So if a Morse Code operator transmitting at a certain speed can send the word \"PARIS\" with the correct spacing exactly 10 times in a minute, then they are transmitting at a speed of 10 words per minute, or 10wpm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The duration of a \"dit\" when the speed is equal to `S` words per minute is equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t_{dit} = \\frac{1.2}{S}$ seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "So at a speed of 10wpm, a single dit has a duration of $t_{dit} = 1.2/10$ seconds, which is $120$ milliseconds, while transmitting the word \"tea\" at the same speed of 10wpm will require exactly $120\\times 11 = 1320$ milliseconds, or $1.32$ seconds (without considering the trailing space of 7 dits after the word \"tea\" itself!).\n",

    "2. the \"dah\" (long pulse)\n",

    "All these lengths are defined in the International Morse Code in terms of the length of the \"dit\", which is considered the \"unit\" of measurement of Morse Code. We have seen already in Question 2(d) that 1) the length of each \"dit\" is equal to 1 dit, 2) the length of each \"dah\" is 3 dits, 3) the length of the space between elements in a character is equal to 1 dit. The remaining spaces are defined as follows: 4) the space between two characters in the same word is equal to 3 dits, 5) the space between two words is equal to 7 dits. So if we consider the string \"my tea\", the total length of its Morse Code representation `\"-- -.--    - . .-    \"`, which includes space between words and after the last word, is equal to 52 dits.

    "- space after \"tea\": 7 dits\n",

    "Notice that the length of a character **alone** does not include the space after the character itself, so that the length of the character `-.-.` (the letter \"C\"), is equal to 11 dits, i.e., 3+1+1+1+3+1+1.\n",

    "Create a function `MorseStringLength()` that takes as input a plain text string `s`, and returns an integer corresponding to the length of the string `s` expressed in \"dits\", according to the length of the Morse Code characters defined in the dictionary `Morse` obtained in Question 1(a) and the convention stated above about the length of each element. The length of `s` **does not take into account any leading space at the beginning of `s` or any trailing space at the end of `s`**. This means that `MorseStringLength(\"c\")` will return `11`, and both `MorseStringLength(\"my tea\")` and `MorseStringLength(\"my tea  \")` will return `45`.

    "(b) (5 marks) Create a function `MorseTime()` that takes as input a string `s` and an integer `S`, and returns a floating point number representing the total time (in seconds) needed to transmit the message in the string `s` in Morse Code at a speed of `S` words per minute. The function will assume that any sequence of one or more blank characters (including spaces, carriage return, tabulation, etc.) will represent a single space between words, and thus corresponds to 7 dits. The function will **not** include in the count the Morse Code representing the trailing space(s) at the end of the last word, or any leading space present before the first word of `s`. Test your function using the string `s=\"Welcome to Ireland\"`, the dictionary `M` equal to the dictionary `Morse` defined in point 1(a), and the speed `S=20` wpm."
